      <strong>Export Records Utility - Complete</strong>
      <br/>
      This tool is intended for use during the <a href="https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/2023+-+01+Patient+Track">FHIR Connectathon</a> in Jan 2023. <br/>
      It allows patients/users to export their electronic medical records from their healthcare providers, in FHIR format.<br/>
      <br/>
      You have completed the authorization process. Please wait while we process your records and attempt to collect them.
      One complete (and if no errors occurred) you will be able to download your records in FHIR format.<br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Please note:</strong><br/>
      - Your data is cached for 24h, this tool is effectively state-less. If you refresh the page, you may need to reauthenticate with your provider.<br/>
      - You can only export one provider at a time. If you want to export from multiple providers, you will need to repeat the process for each provider.<br/>
      - The export may take a while to process (5+minutes), if you have a long history with that provider.<br/>
      - Some sources may not be working correctly.<br/>
      - Exports larger than 10MB will fail, as the limited infrastructure serving this tool is not able to handle large files. If you have a large export, please reach out to us directly to retrieve your payload.<br/>
